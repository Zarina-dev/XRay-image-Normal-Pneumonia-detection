# XRay-image-Normal-Pneumonia-detection
Pnuemonia Normal detection by using XRay images. 

You can start reading the project in this order:

1) [ data_prepare.py ] Data preparation ( jpg/png formal --> numpy array)..
2) [ model_build.py  ] Building Artificial Neural Network , training, testing 
3) [     main.py     ] Putting all them together , predicting New datas which are not seen by model

                    ==> [ final result with caidation test as a new.png]   
                    ==> [ plot_calid_predicted(2).png                  ]
                    
* [ requirements.txt]
* [ sources.txt     ] links to the sites from which I used image datas -> Got image datas from kaggle(link is given in sources.txt file) also normal xray images from other site (also link is given) in order to avoid data disbalancing.
